## Artisan file:
I've met with various challenges when try to find resources concerning about Laravel, neither the AIs could help!, so alot of pain & fructuation was used.

## Pre-knowledge about Artisan:
According to [Laravel documentations](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/artisan),they define the laravel file as:
>![image](https://github.com/isaka-james/laravel-analysis/assets/76619967/65af8aa1-4f6a-4ec2-b7d8-7e9c1465a0a1)

>As you can see, *artisan* file is like the file that acts as the entry point for Laravel's CLI(Command Line Interface), and it allows you to execute Laravel commands directly from the CLI of your operating system.

## Let's GO
Let go line by line from the artisan file:


### Artisan: line 1
```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
```
This is the first line known as shebang or hashbang, if you ever used bash, I know you may be familiar with this line, this is the line that is used to indicate to the system what interpreter should be used to execute the script that follows, in this case **PHP**.
>Although this line is not necessary, even without this line the artisan file may execute either way, but it is recommended to use that line. Also if it happens you installed the **PHP** on another location then it is crutual to match the shebang of the **PHP** according to your installations.

### artisan: line 2-5
```php
<?php
 
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\ArgvInput;
   
```
The legendary `<?php` marks the start of the **PHP** script, 
>  The `use` statement imports the `ArgvInput` class from the `Symfony\Component\Console\Input` namespace. This class is part of the Symfony Console component, which Laravel leverages for command-line functionality.At first I was very confused because I didn't see the *Symfony* directory at the root directory. As that is what the `namespace` and `use` works, But upon close investigation I saw that it is handled on the `symfony` library so we can find them in the *vendor* directory, also I was confused that `use` was used when on the top there were no `include` nor `require` but a little I didn't know that I can put this line after the require(after line 9), and still it will work! 

### artisan: line 6-7
```php
define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));
   
```
So this line declare the constant named `LARAVEL_START` that store the value of this prebuilt **PHP** function called `microtime` that takes the argument `true` means that it returns the float value unless if it was `false` then it could return string. That function return the current Unix timestamp with microseconds.
> The purpose of this function is starts up the timer, so you can time how long it takes to boot up the framework.But I've not seen it be used in the framework, maybe you can measure yourself haha!.

### artisan: line  8-11
```php
// Register the Composer autoloader...
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
    
   
```
As the comment says that the following line is registering the *composer autoloader*, by means of the libraries that included here are from composer not laravel related, so I'll explain them a little since they are non-laravel.
> The line 9 is including the Composer autoloader file into the current script. This autoloader file is generated by Composer and is responsible for automatically loading classes and files from the installed Composer dependencies.

> By including this file, Laravel ensures that all classes from Composer dependencies are autoloaded and available for use within the application. This approach simplifies dependency management and improves code organization. Hence meaning that all the classes that have been loaded can be used!

#### What is autoloader.php
The file found here `vendor/autoloader.php`, go [here](non-laravel/autoloader.php) . I've not explained more because it is non-laravel!
